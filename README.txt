Short Description: This code is designed to take as an input a .SVG image, rasterize it,
		   and output the corresponding .bmp image.

How to run it: Use input .svg file as a CLA $./SVG2BMP.out <input.svg>

Note: Certain test images can cause a seg fault when parts of the image being filled are outside the image
	  I wrote this for compilation with g++ compiler, I have no idea how this works with any other compiler on any other system
